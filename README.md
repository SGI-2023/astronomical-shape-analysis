# Analyzing initial cells of the Universe
The Universe is like old milk! Initially smooth and uniform with very tiny density fluctuations, it became clumpier over time as gravity pulled more matter into denser regions. Today, we observe late-time galaxies, and it is natural to ask whether we can track back the evolution of cosmic structures and find the initial patches from which they formed. Reconstructing these initial patches allows us to better understand the Universe's expansion history and how galaxies have evolved. In a recent study by (Nikakhtar et al. 2022 Phys Rev Lett.), we introduced a fast semi-discrete optimal transport algorithm and successfully applied it to cosmological simulations. Our next step is to quiantify the similarity between the shape of the reconstructed Laguerre cells and the initial patches each galaxy inhabited. This is the goal of this SGI project and we plan to compare these 3D objects and compute their shape similarities.
